            <h3 className={classes.content}>Our very very brief history so far…<br></br>

Almost everyone craves to start a new and small start-up business or company of their own, where something will connect potential customers to the brand.<br></br> Sri Vinayaka Technologies  (in short SVT)  is a start up as well as a dream come true business/company. 

We had dream about the company a few years ago, as we had finished our  graduation. As a fresher out of the college had a thought in mind to start up a  company which deals with electronic hardware development and services. Unfortunately that  did not turned into reality in beginning years because of  fund and lack of business management. But again got an opportunity, encouragement and support to  make our dream come true from our family & friends. 

We decided that our Embedded system service and components support would only use the finest devices and technology, have the friendliest products to use and the most lovable products in the present development for our customers. 

<br></br>Thank you for your support. <br></br>
